Here are some research papers specifically focusing on data security in the context of packet transfer:

1. **"Security in Software-Defined Networks: A Survey"** by Haibo Cheng, Yuming Mao, Zhenyu Shen, and Dijiang Huang. This paper discusses security challenges and solutions in Software-Defined Networking (SDN), including packet-level security mechanisms. [Link: IEEE Xplore](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7738984)

2. **"Security Issues in Mobile Ad Hoc Networks: A Survey"** by Sonal R. Gagare and S. D. Lokhande. This survey paper explores security concerns in mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs), including packet security against attacks like eavesdropping, spoofing, and packet dropping.
