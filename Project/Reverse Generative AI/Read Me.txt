the names of some popular image generative models:

1. **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)**:
   - DCGAN (Deep Convolutional GAN)
   - StyleGAN (and StyleGAN2)
   - CycleGAN
   - ProGAN (Progressive GAN)
   - BigGAN
   - SNGAN (Spectral Normalization GAN)

2. **Variational Autoencoders (VAEs)**:
   - Vanilla VAE
   - Beta-VAE
   - Conditional VAE
   - Adversarial Autoencoder (AAE)
   - InfoVAE
   - β-TCVAE (β-Twin Consistency VAE)
   
3. **Autoregressive Models**:
   - PixelCNN
   - PixelRNN
   - WaveNet (primarily used for audio generation but can be adapted for images)

4. **Transformer-based Models**:
   - GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer)
   - DALL-E (for generating images from textual descriptions)

5. **Neuroevolutionary Models**:
   - NEAT (NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies)
   - HyperNEAT (Hypercube-based NEAT)
   - CPPN (Compositional Pattern-Producing Networks)

6. **Other Models**:
   - DeepDream
   - Neural Style Transfer (NST)
   - Deep Belief Networks (DBNs)
